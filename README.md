This project helps us determine the best way to invest in top technology stocks by using data and analysis. 
It focuses on five major companies: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), AMD, Cisco (CSCO), and Qualcomm (QCOM). 
The team studied stock price data from 2010 to 2024 to understand trading volumes, price changes, and returns. 
They used a forecasting method called SARIMAX to predict stock prices for 2025, helping identify future trends and risks.
Using this information, they built an investment portfolio aimed at earning a 15% yearly return while keeping risk low. 
The final portfolio gave more weight to CSCO, MSFT, and AAPL, and avoided AMD due to high risk.
The project also suggests ways to improve investment strategies, like including global stocks, watching economic indicators, and preparing for market changes.
Overall, this project shows how analyzing past trends, predicting future prices, and building smart portfolios can help investors make confident and informed decisions.
